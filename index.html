                                    San Diego’s location, adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border makes it a hotspot for human trafficking due to the high volume of cross-border traffic and insufficient resources to monitor every entry point. Considering that Mexico is the primary country that most people who are trafficked go through, San Diego’s proximity to Mexico makes it extremely easy for traffickers to quickly abduct and traffic people. People who are trafficked vary in age and gender demographics—38% of human trafficking victims are children (22% girls and 16% boys), 39% are adult women, and 23% are adult men. In most cases, victims are of lower-income with many being homeless. The LGBTQ+ community is targeted even more—with members being more likely to be trafficked. Once in the network, most victims spend an average of 20 months in forced labor. The average age at which minors are forced into sex trafficking is between 12 to 14 years old, and the average lifespan of a victim after entering sex trafficking is approximately 7 years.

                                    The root cause of human trafficking is the demand. It is driven by individuals with sick and exploitative intentions who create a market for slavery, forced labor, and sexual exploitation. This demand fuels an underground economy which preys on the most vulnerable populations. Victims of human trafficking are often forced into what has been known as modern-day slavery, where victims are forced to work under brutal and inhumane conditions. In many cases, the products they produce or the services they provide are consumed by the average American, who usually doesn't even know they're contributing to modern slavery and human trafficking.

                                    Human trafficking in San Diego is a huge violation to numerous human rights principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Realistically, human trafficking undermines and goes against the entire UHDR document. It strips individuals of all of their rights listed in the document. Victims of trafficking are at the will of whoever is currently trafficking them and are restricted to the limited, if any, freedom they give them. However, if you are solely looking at what specific articles it violates, disregarding the facts that almost all other rights are nullified when you are being trafficked, primarily, Article 4 is violated, which explicitly states, “No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.” Victims of human trafficking are subjected to conditions that are very, very much similar to slavery, realistically it is slavery, whether through forced labor, sexual exploitation, or servitude. Additionally, Article 3, which asserts the right to “life, liberty, and security of person,” is directly undermined, as trafficked individuals are stripped of their autonomy, safety, and freedom. Article 5 is also violated, which prohibits “torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” as victims often endure extreme abuse, violence, and dehumanization. Traffickers further violate Article 13, which guarantees “freedom of movement and residence,” by forcibly relocating and confining individuals against their will. Lastly, Article 23 is violated, as victims are denied the right to “just and favorable conditions of work” and are often coerced into unsafe, exploitative labor without compensation. All in all, human trafficking primarily violates 4 of the 30 rights highlighted in the UHDR.

                                    Human trafficking victims in San Diego are diverse and it isn't just one group being targeted. However, that doesn't mean all groups are targeted equally. Many groups fit into specific high-risk categories due to their vulnerabilities. According to a 2016 study conducted by the University of San Diego, the average age of entry into trafficking is 16 years old, with many victims being recruited directly from high schools. In fact, 90% of high schools in San Diego County reported cases of students who were victims of sex trafficking. This is an insane number and shows just how bad this is in our area!
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-start">
                                    Demographically, victims are predominantly women and girls, however, men and boys are also affected. Vulnerable populations include homeless youth, with LGBTQ+ youth particularly at risk due to family rejection and higher rates of homelessness. National data shows that 40% of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ+, and they are disproportionately targeted by traffickers. Labor trafficking is another form of victimization which is prevalent in San Diego, particularly among undocumented immigrants and migrant workers. Many are forced into exploitative labor conditions in industries like agriculture, hospitality, and domestic work (a topic I believe Jack Jin is covering with wage left). These victims are often lured by promises of work, only to find themselves trapped in abusive situations where they are deprived of freedom and fair wages.

                                <p class="text-start">
                                    In San Diego, the violators are, in most if not nearly all cases, highly organized groups or individuals exploiting others for profit. In other words, disgustingly, it’s highly commercialized. Roughly 85% of traffickers involved in San Diego’s sex trafficking operations are gang-affiliated, with around 110 gangs operating in our region. These groups use coercion, fraud, and violence to control their victims, often employing tactics such as threatening family members or exploiting victims’ undocumented status to bring them into the trafficking network.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-start">
                                    Traffickers can also include individuals who act alone, as well as businesses that knowingly or unknowingly facilitate trafficking. For example, hotels and motels near major highways or convention centers have been identified as key locations where trafficking transactions occur. This is particularly evident during large events such as Comic-Con, which draw significant tourist traffic and inadvertently create opportunities for exploitation. Obviously, Comic-Con didn’t directly know it was happening, but events like these are where a lot of trafficking starts. In one recent operation during Comic-Con, 14 individuals were arrested, and 10 victims were rescued from trafficking situations. Buyers play a significant role in fueling the trafficking industry. Demand for commercial sex and exploitative labor incentivize traffickers.

                                <p class="text-start">
                                    Bystanders in human trafficking include individuals and institutions that unknowingly enable or fail to prevent exploitation. In San Diego, community members who come into contact with trafficking victims often lack the awareness or training to recognize the signs of exploitation. For instance, someone might observe suspicious behavior at a hotel or workplace but dismiss it as a personal or isolated issue.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-start">
                                    Businesses can also act as bystanders, particularly in industries like hospitality and transportation. Hotels, for example, are frequently used as sites for trafficking, yet staff may fail to report or even notice warning signs such as frequent room turnover, guests paying in cash, or individuals appearing distressed. Similarly, rideshare and taxi services can unintentionally aid traffickers by transporting victims and clients.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-start">
                                    The role of bystanders is critical because increased awareness and intervention can disrupt trafficking networks. Public awareness campaigns in San Diego, such as those during Human Trafficking Awareness Month, aim to educate potential bystanders about their responsibility to act. Even with that though, it’s hard. In many cases, people are too scared to see what is happening in front of them. It’s hard to tell if a person is being trafficked; even if they’re showing signs. Many don’t want to call law enforcement in fear that the person isn’t being trafficked.

                                <p class="text-start">
                                    San Diego has several groups and individuals actively combating human trafficking, working tirelessly as upstanders to protect victims and disrupt trafficking networks. The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force (HTTF) is a multi-agency coalition that coordinates law enforcement efforts to identify and rescue victims while prosecuting traffickers. The task force’s victim-centered approach ensures that survivors receive support rather than criminalization. For instance, a recent HTTF operation resulted in 12 arrests and provided comprehensive support services to six victims.
                                    Nonprofit organizations play a critical role in addressing the long-term needs of survivors. GenerateHope, for example, offers housing, therapy, and education to help survivors rebuild their lives. Free to Thrive provides legal aid, assisting survivors with issues like restraining orders, custody disputes, and criminal record expungement. The Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition (BSCC) works on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent trafficking and assist victims.
                                    Public awareness campaigns and grassroots efforts also contribute to the fight against trafficking. Events like the Break Free Run, an annual fundraiser for anti-trafficking initiatives, engage the community and raise funds to support survivors. Bystanders who report suspicious activity to hotlines or law enforcement also play an essential role in preventing trafficking.

                        <p class="text-start">
                            The main reason rights are being violated is because of greed, lust, and a lack of moral decency. Traffickers are driven in many instances by greed as the industry is sickeningly lucrative. Buyers, on the other hand, are often buying prostitution in an act of lust. Some are unaware they are participating in human trafficking, others aren’t and are simply the worst and most disgusting people.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            Traffickers, who are often driven by financial incentives, don't view their victims as human beings, they view them seemingly as nothing more than commodities to be exploited. In San Diego, the underground sex economy is estimated to generate $810 million annually, making it an attractive industry for perpetrators seeking high profits with minimal risks. As mentioned earlier, many traffickers are part of organized crime syndicates or gangs. These groups use trafficking not only as a revenue stream but also as a method of exerting power and control within their territories. Traffickers employ various tactics to recruit and retain victims, including deception, coercion, and outright violence.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            Buyers play an equally critical role in trafficking. Without demand, the industry would collapse. Many buyers fail to consider the origins of the services they consume. While prostitution is very much illegal in the U.S. and San Diego, it still happens, and in many cases, prostitutes are being trafficked.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            Additionally, there are also economic motivations surrounding cheap labor. Many countries require large workforces that are supplied by trafficking victims. Perpetrators often sell victims to operations in these countries in the interest of making money on the value of other peoples lives...
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            The U.S. Department of Labor has identified over 150 goods produced through forced labor, yet the complexity of supply chains makes it difficult to ensure ethical production practices. Traffickers profit by exploiting both the vulnerabilities of their victims and the ignorance of consumers, who are often unaware of the human cost behind the products they purchase.

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Human trafficking is one of the most dehumanizing violations of human rights, robbing individuals of their dignity and freedom while leaving long-lasting scars. Victims are subjected to environments that strip away their autonomy, subjecting them to physical, emotional, and psychological harm. The impact extends far beyond the immediate exploitation, often leaving survivors with lifelong trauma and significant barriers to rebuilding their lives.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            The loss of dignity begins with the traffickers’ treatment of victims as commodities. Many survivors report being objectified, with traffickers referring to them as “goods” or “merchandise,” underscoring the complete disregard for their humanity. This dehumanization is compounded by the physical and sexual abuse victims endure. In cases of labor trafficking, individuals are forced into grueling conditions, often working long hours without pay or rest, under constant threat of violence. Victims of sex trafficking frequently experience repeated sexual violence, leaving profound psychological scars. Survivors often describe a pervasive sense of worthlessness, as they are made to feel that their sole purpose is to generate profit for their traffickers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            The psychological toll is immense. Victims frequently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. The relentless fear and unpredictability of their environment can rewire the brain. This often leaves survivors in a state of hyper-vigilance. Many are so traumatized they are still dealing with the effects of the trauma. Even after escaping trafficking, many survivors continue to feel unsafe, as their trauma prevents them from trusting others or feeling secure. Some victims develop learned helplessness, a psychological state where they believe they cannot change their circumstances, even when opportunities to escape arise. This manipulation by traffickers, combined with physical confinement, creates an environment where victims feel entirely trapped.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            Freedom, a fundamental human right, is completely stripped from trafficking victims. Many are confined in physically restrictive environments, such as locked rooms or isolated work sites. Others may be forced to move frequently, further isolating them from any potential support systems. Beyond physical captivity, traffickers use psychological manipulation to maintain control. Threats of harm to victims’ families, withholding of identification documents, and constant surveillance ensure that victims are unable to leave, even when physical barriers are absent.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            The stigma surrounding trafficking adds another layer of harm, often isolating survivors from their communities. Victims of sex trafficking, in particular, may face judgment or ostracization, making reintegration into society exceedingly difficult. This social rejection exacerbates the psychological trauma and reinforces feelings of shame and worthlessness. Survivors often struggle to reclaim their sense of self-worth, as years of exploitation and abuse have eroded their confidence and identity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            In addition to these individual impacts, trafficking undermines the broader concept of human dignity by perpetuating a culture where exploitation is normalized. The prevalence of trafficking in global supply chains, for example, ties everyday consumer goods to forced labor, indirectly implicating society in the violation of freedom and dignity. From coffee to electronics, many products are produced under conditions that exploit trafficked laborers, further eroding the global standard for human rights.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            Restoring the dignity and freedom of survivors requires much more than rescue. Even when victims are saved it still leaves a scar. This is why organizations that help rehabilitate victims and help get them on their feet are so important.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-start">
                            In my opinion, I don't see how human trafficking effects the perpetrators' dignity or freedom. They are ultimately the driving force behind taking other's freedom and I could see how they have lost a significant amount of their humanity and human decency, but I don't see how their dignity and freedom is effected.

Law enforcement and the various task forces and organizations can only do so much, and they're counting on more people becoming aware of the problem and helping.

                            Human trafficking in San Diego strongly follows and contributes to patterns observed nationally and globally. This emphasizes just how widespread and interconnected the nature of this human rights violation is. Almost all the problems we see here in San Diego are seen and amplified across the country. Here’s how it fits into the larger picture:

                        <!-- National Context -->

                                <strong>Trafficking Hotspot:</strong> 
                                San Diego is one of the top 13 regions in the United States for human trafficking according to the FBI this shows the city’s role in the broader national crisis going on. Similar patterns exist in other border and metropolitan areas like Houston and Los Angeles, where similar issues are happening.
                            <li class="mt-2">
                                <strong>Underground Economy:</strong> 
                                The $810 million sex trafficking economy in San Diego, that had been mentioned numerous times, reflects a broader issue of trafficking’s economic incentives across the U.S. Nationally, trafficking generates billions annually. Us San Diegans are just one part of a much larger problem.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Victim Demographics:</strong> 
                                The demographics of trafficking victims in San Diego—many of which are minors, undocumented immigrants, or members of marginalized groups—are consistent with what we see on the national trends. The National Human Trafficking Hotline reports that women and children are disproportionately affected, with many victims recruited through similar means, such as online platforms or coercion. Same thing, different places.

                                <strong>Legislation and Enforcement:</strong> 
                                San Diego benefits from state-level anti-trafficking measures like Proposition 35 and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, aligning with federal laws such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). However, the challenges of enforcement and victim identification aren't limited to just San Diego... everywhere has these issues.

                                <strong>Cross-Border Trafficking:</strong> 
                                San Diego’s role as a border city places it at the intersection of global trafficking networks. Victims from Central America, Asia, and other regions are trafficked through the U.S.-Mexico border, reflecting global patterns where migration vulnerabilities are exploited.

                                <strong>Labor Exploitation in Supply Chains:</strong> 
                                The forced labor reported in San Diego’s agriculture and domestic work sectors ties into a global issue where products like coffee, electronics, and clothing are frequently linked to trafficking. According to the International Labour Organization, 27.6 million people worldwide are trapped in forced labor, highlighting the interconnectedness of local and global supply chains.

                                <strong>Global Economic Impact:</strong> 
                                Trafficking generates an estimated $150 billion annually worldwide, which is a jaw-dropping, horrific number. Regions like San Diego contribute to this figure through both local demand for commercial sex and industries reliant on forced labor. The city’s economic role underscores its place in a global economy that often prioritizes profit over ethical practices.

                                <strong>Human Rights Violations:</strong> 
                                Trafficking in San Diego violates the same universal human rights principles enshrined in international agreements like the United Nations’ Palermo Protocol and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These global frameworks emphasize the right to freedom, dignity, and protection, which trafficking undermines universally.
